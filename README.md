# Go Testing
These are some jottings and practice + reference code written during the "Go unit, integration, and functional testing" course which I did on Udemy. 

## Types of Unit Testing
In general, there are three types of unit testing performed in Go. They are:
- Unit testing
- Intergation testing
- Functional testing
